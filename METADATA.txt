Output from running XBeach 

Each element contains the following variables:
    params = parameters settings
    log = log file print out of settings
    varsavail = available output variables
    x = x grid 
    y = y grid 
    z = elevations grid 
    time = time vector for available instantaneous output variables
    time_mean = time vector for available mean output variables
    waves = wave input time series (Hmo = height, fp = frequency, mainang = direction)
    tide = water level time series (t = time, wl1 = wl2 = water level deviation from mean)
    timeStepsRead = length of time vector for instantaneous output variables
    meanTimeStepsRead = length of time vector for mean output variables
    zb = modeled post-storm elevation grid
    yp = interpolated alongshore coordinate of the 'shoreline' (defined as 10cm contour)
    area = computed subaerial area for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
    width = computed subaerial width for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
    zc = dune crest elevation for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
    xc = x-shore position of dune crest for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
	     positive values are ONSHORE of the pre-storm dune crest; negative values are OFFSHORE of the pre-storm dune crest
    zt = dune toe elevation for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
    xt = x-shore position of dune toe for each alongshore transect;  col1 = pre-storm; col2 = post-storm
		 positive values are ONSHORE of the pre-storm dune crest; negative values are OFFSHORE of the pre-storm dune crest


Files description:

-	XB_primary_tracking.mat:  this is the primary frontal dune identified in the pre-storm DEM and the new post-storm location. This has the dune toe and crest location and elevation for each tracked dune.  Keep in mind that the primary frontal dune can be lost entirely and the post-storm dune crest can be associated with a secondary feature. That means at times, the post-storm dune crest can sometimes be higher than the pre-storm. I believe issues with this were why we switched to the fixed positions and max height instead.

-	XB_primary_fixed.mat:  this is the erosion measured at the position of the pre-storm frontal dune crest.  The pre-storm dune crest elevation here is the same as in the file above. The dune toe here is pretty useless though.  The pre-storm zt is still in there, but the post-storm dune toe does NOT correspond to the dune crest height (xc(:,2)). This file is just for looking at erosion at the original dune crest location.

-	XB_maxisland_tracking.mat:  this is the pre- and post-storm maximum island elevation, characterising translocation in dune features. The main morphological variables considered in our nalayis were extracted from here.

-	XB_maxisland_fixed.mat:  this is the pre- and post-storm maximum island elevation looking at a fixed position.

-	XB_primary_ikm_tracking.mat:  this is the primary frontal dune identified in the pre-storm DEM and the new post-storm location for Ivan and Katrina hindcasts.

-	XB_primary_ikm_fixed.mat:  this is the erosion measured at the position of the pre-storm frontal dune crest for Ivan and Katrina hindcasts.

-	XB_maxisland_ikm_tracking.mat:  this is the pre- and post-storm maximum island elevation, characterising translocation in dune features, for Ivan and Katrina hindcasts.

-	XB_maxisland_ikm_fixed.mat:  this is the pre- and post-storm maximum island elevation looking at a fixed position  for Ivan and Katrina hindcasts.

- 	MDA_res_USGS: MATLAB file containing synthetic sea-storms (Values) from Wahl et al. (2016), their time series (Ts), peaks and intensities (peak_int), and selected events via MDA (Ev3).
